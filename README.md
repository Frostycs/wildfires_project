[Wildfires In Washington State Geo-Narrative](https://Frostycs.github.io/wildfires_project/index.html)
## Project Description
Wildfires cause harm to the forestry and terrain of land, and with wildfire data, we can find where wildfires most occur and during which time in correlation to the health of the forests around where the wildfire starts. Using a geo-narrative to map our data would be the best way to represent our idea. We will use a geo-narrative with thematic layers to show the change in wildfires over time.
## Project Goal
Our groups goal for this project is to make an easy to navigate, use, and understand geo-narrative that represents how wildfires in Washington State have affected the forest health negatively between 1990-2019. We also wanted to learn for ourselves how these wildfires have affected the state. It was also important for us to represent and explain the trends we saw in the story map section of our geo-narrative so users can easily understand what the map is representing.

## Target Audience
Our target audience is people interested in environmental health, homeowners, construction planning, and environmental hazards.
## Functions
We are going to be using a geo-narrative to display wildfire data and the changes in these wildfires over time, to reveal common locations of wildfires and if the frequency of these wildfires is increasing or decreasing throughout the years of 1990-2019. We will do this by using interactive elements on maps and multiple maps representing different periods of time with the same variable of data.
## Map Projection
  - Mercator projection
  - Center: State of Washington [-120.34, 48.02]
  - Zoom level: 8
## Base Map
  - Monochrome base map of Washington State
## Description of Thematic Layers
1. Three maps of Washington state. One that represents big fires in Washington State between 1990-2019. A second map with a button to display the data for forest health between the years 1990-200. Our third map has a button to display the data for forest health between the years 2008-2019. We represented forest health by acres burned using these paramaters: [1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000]. This will also be represented in a legend. You can view the map layers singularly or you can display more than one map layer at the same time. 

2. The acres of fires burned can be seen by clicking on the data points 

3. The user also has the option of selecting a map layer by clicking on its
corresponding story in the story box.

4. A legend that effectively explains the elements displayed on the map layers.

5. An element on the bottom of the map that allows users to select/filter the year(s) they wish to see for the forest health map layer(s) they have selected using a button function. 

6. An "Information" pop-up that will explain to users how to navigate through the geo-narrative that can be re-accessed as needed by clicking the "Info" link in the far upper left corner of our map. 

7. Data Sources Include:

https://data-wadnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/wadnr::forest-health-aerial-survey-1980-2019/explore?location=47.250338%2C-120.852550%2C8.03

https://data-wadnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/wadnr::washington-large-fires-1973-2020/explore?location=47.250616%2C-120.352519%2C7.22

8. Vector layer using the forest fire location and year data as well as forest health data by year.
## Story Line Draft
The map on the left gives information about the wildfires in Washington and the map on the right gives information about the damage done to the environment. Map 1 shows large fires, map 2 shows the forest damage done between the years 1990-2007, and map 3 shows the forest damage done between 2008-2019. You can use the buttons at the bottom of the map to see how the fire damage hase changed through the years. Multimedia would include the button function and the "Info" link to re-access the Information pop-up. To go from scene to scene we would scroll through the story and use the button functions to switch between map layers and years.
## Applied Libraries

## Acknowledgement
Things we would like to further explore that remain unanswered after our project include:
- If the forest health of these burned areas has improved or worsened over time. 
- How these fires have changed the terrain of these areas
- How wildlife and people have been affected and if they can still reside in these areas.
