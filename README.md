# Wildfires In Washington State
## Project Proposal
Wildfire causes harm to buildings around them from the spread, and with wildfire data, we can find where wildfires most occur and during which time in correlation to the health of the forests around where the wildfire starts, Using a geo-narrative to map our data would be the best way to represent our idea. We will use a geo-narrative with thematic layers to show the change of wildfires over time.
### Here is a sketch-up of our project idea

## Target Audience
Our target audience is people interested in environmental health, homeowners, construction planning, and environmental hazards.
## Functions
We are going to be using a geo-narrative to display wildfire data and the changes of these fires over periods of time, to reveal common locations of fires and how much or less the fire has spread throughout years. We will do this by using interactive elements on maps and multiple maps on different time periods with the same variable of data.
## Libraries
## Map Projection
  - Mercator projection
  - Center: State of Washington
  - Zoom level: 8
## Base Map
  - Monochrome base map of Washington State
## Description of Thematic Layers
1. Two maps of Washington state; one with a side bar of forest health between the years 2010-2019; a second map with a side bar of forest fires
between the years 2010-2019 with a hover interactive element that enables the user to hover over different areas of Washington and see when/where
different forest fires have occurred.
2. Data Sources Include:
https://data-wadnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/wadnr::forest-health-aerial-survey-1980-2019/explore?location=47.250338%2C-120.852550%2C8.03
https://data-wadnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/wadnr::washington-large-fires-1973-2020/explore?location=47.250616%2C-120.352519%2C7.22
3. Vector layer using the forest fire location and year data as well as forest health data by year. We will include a hover interactive function as explained in bullet point 2 under description of thematic layers.
## Story Line Draft
The map on the left gives information about the wildfires in Washington and the map on the right gives information about the damage done to both the environment and properties. Map 1 shows the fires and map 2 shows the damage done. You can use a slider at the bottom of the map to see how the fire and damage changes through the years. Depending on which map you are looking at, the legend and thematic elements will display different information. Multimedia would include the side bar function and any charts we see fit to be added as we develop the project. To go from scene to scene we could use a toggle function and the slider function.
