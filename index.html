          <h1 class="story-head">Wildfire Damage 1990-2007</h1>
          <p class="story-text">The most intense areas where we have the most acres burned by fires
            in Washington seem focused near its border with Canada and Idaho, the center, and all
            along the coast of Washington but are noticeably less intense than those that seem to
            take place in the east and the interior from 1990 to 1992.
          </p>
          <p class="story-text">From 1992 to 1994 there seems to be an increase in the acres burned
            by fires in the interior. It stagnated like this until 1996.
          </p>
          <p class="story-text">From 1996 to 1998 while we do see a partial decrease in fires in the
             interior, we see larger fires break out along Washington's border with Canada and Idaho.
          </p>
          <p class="story-text">We see an increase in the number of acres burned and the incidences
             in the interior and along the borders to the east and the west coast from 1998 to 2000
             and remains consistent until 2002 from 2002 to 2005 we see a large increase of fires
             and the acres burned focused in the center and the border between Canada, Washington,
             and Idaho.

          <p class="story-text">Wildfires frequency seems to have increased drastically since 2008.
            This newer dataset consists much more information than the old one, and we were able to
            show you more information such as the cause of the fires.
